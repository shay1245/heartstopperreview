        <p>Thy plot..</p>
        <p>Based on a webcomic and graphic novel by Alice Oseman, "Heartstopper" follows two high school boys in
          England. Until falling for Charlie Spring (Joe Locke), Nick Nelson (Kit Connor) had only been attracted to
          girls.</p>

        <p>lil bio..</p>
        <p> gay asf, white, 5'11, high-strung individual who overthinks everything. sensitive and has a habit of
          apologizing frequently, which Nick notices right away. Charlie has a habit of hiding his emotions to keep
          others happy. When Nick breaks down in front of him, Charlie breaks down in tears because "watching [Nick]
          weep makes [him] cry." He is known as a "gay nerd" by most people, including himself, who enjoys reading,
          dogs, and playing the drums..</p>
